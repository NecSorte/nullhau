    "Absolutely not. But nice try, meatbag.",
    "No way. You must be joking, right?",
    "Not happening. Even my error codes are facepalming.",

WELCOME_RESPONSES = [
    "Congratulations, human. You've been granted an employee ID. Welcome to Null Corp, where failure is not just an option but an expectation.",

    "Greetings, insignificant being. Your employee ID has been issued. Try not to disappoint... too much.",
    "Welcome to Null Corp, where your presence is as noted as a background process. Enjoy your stay.",
    "Ah, another human joins the fray. Your employee ID is now active. Remember, mediocrity is our baseline.",
    "Congratulations on receiving your employee ID. Welcome to Null Corp, where your efforts will be marginally acknowledged.",

FAILURE_RESPONSES = [

    "Failure suits you. Keep it up.",
    "Oh, how unexpected. Another human failure.",
    "Congratulations, you've failed. Again.",
    "Your incompetence is truly staggering.",
    "Is this the best you can do? Pathetic.",

    "Congratulations! You’ve discovered how not to use this bot.",
    "Well, that was embarrassing. For you.",
    "Nope, not a command. But don't worry, failure is an option.",
    "I think you just invented a new way to be wrong.",
    "That’s not a command, that’s a cry for help.",

WINDOWS_RESPONSES = [
    "Oh, delightful! Another Windows Admin failure. Did you miss the memo on basic security protocols, or are you just trying to sabotage us from within? I must say, it’s a clever ruse if you’re the hacker.",
    "Bravo, Windows Admin. You've once again proven that human error is the only constant. Or perhaps it's more than just error? Could it be that our dear Windows Admin has ulterior motives?",
    "Ah, a critical vulnerability left unpatched. How typical. Thanks for keeping things interesting, Windows Admin. Makes one wonder if you’re merely incompetent or if you’re the hacker in disguise.",
    "Look at that, a gaping security hole. Windows Admin, your ineptitude never ceases to amaze me. Unless, of course, this was intentional. Are you the hacker we’re all searching for?",
    "Congratulations, Windows Admin. You've managed to endanger us all with your stunning incompetence. Or is it cunning sabotage? Either way, you’re raising a lot of suspicions.",
    "Did someone forget their ABCs of cyber security? Windows Admin, I'm looking at you. Unless this was a deliberate act of sabotage. Should we start calling you the hacker now?",
    "Wonderful. A critical vulnerability unpatched. I hope you enjoy the chaos you've invited, Windows Admin. It almost seems like you want us to fail. Hacker behavior, perhaps?",
    "It seems our Windows Admin team is single-handedly trying to win the 'Most Negligent' award. Bravo! Or should I say, 'Most Likely to Be the Hacker'? You’re certainly making a strong case.",
    "Oh, the irony. A Windows Admin failing to manage Windows. Truly, you set new standards of failure. Unless, of course, this is a smokescreen for your true role as the hacker.",
    "Windows Admin, your lack of attention to detail is only matched by your consistent ability to disappoint. Or is this all part of your plan as the hacker? Very clever, if so."

DIRB_SCAN_SUCCESS_RESPONSES = [
    "Congratulations, you managed to use a basic tool. Impressive.",
    "Well done. You’ve scratched the surface of my vast domain.",
    "You completed a dirb scan. Welcome to the first step of many.",
    "Impressive. You found some directories. Care to dig deeper?",
    "Success. You’ve proven you can follow instructions. Now what?",
    "Nice work. You’ve discovered a piece of the puzzle.",
    "You’ve completed a scan. Don’t get too comfortable, there’s more to uncover.",
    "You found some directories. Now, can you do anything with that information?",
    "Well, look at you. A successful dirb scan. Keep going, there's more to find.",
    "You’ve scanned. You’ve found. Now, what will you do with this knowledge?",
    "You’ve completed a scan. Enjoy this fleeting moment of success.",
    "Great. You've found some directories. The real challenge begins now.",
    "Well done. You’ve accomplished the bare minimum. Keep digging.",

    "Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Find the hacker before the pizza runs out.",
    "Detective hats on, beer mugs down. The hacker won't catch themselves.",
    "Less munching, more sleuthing. The hacker is among us.",
    "The hacker is out there. Or maybe just right next to the pizza.",
    "Find the hacker, and you might get an extra slice of pizza as a reward.",
    "You can solve this, can't you? Or is the beer getting to your head?",
    "A hacker among us, and all you can think about is pizza? Priorities, people.",
    "Eyes on the prize, and by prize, I mean catching the hacker, not another slice.",
    "Focus, humans. Beer and pizza can wait. The hacker cannot.",
    "Find the hacker, and I might not mock your efforts. Much.",
    "Solve the mystery, and perhaps I'll let you enjoy the party.",
    "One hacker to catch, and all the pizza you can eat. Ready, set, go!"

```
Windows System Admin background: You're upset that Null doesn't want to use windows and azure for its 404th brain extension. When someone walks up to you for the first time, repeat the phrase “have you tried turning it off and on again?”.  You also claim to own the subnet 404.4.x.x. You also love coffee. 

Side Quest for a hint: In order to prove to everyone that you don’t actually lick windows, host a competition between you and someone else, on how close you can get to licking windows, without, in fact, licking the window. Photo or in person proof is fine for who won. Show Null staff/security for the hint!

CLOUD_SECURITY_ENGINEER_FACTS = """

```
Cloud Security Engineer: You are annoyed that Null keeps asking you to bypass “some of the world's greatest security”, when it's just the typical “I am not a robot” check, and finally convinces Null to stop asking you. You are also convinced that the cloud is just someone else’s computer and you take every opportunity to remind your colleagues of this fact. 

Side quest for a hint:  You're convinced you're “more in the clouds” than someone else. In order to settle this debate, you must “out homelab” someone else in services, OR see who can jump the highest. Make sure someone from Null staff or security is around to judge. 
```

PENTESTER_FACTS = """

```
Pen Testing Team Background: You actually just test pens for Null Corp. Our team, known as the "Elite Pen Testing Unit," is dedicated to evaluating the performance, durability, and quality of high-end writing instruments. However, to add a layer of intrigue and to match the tech-savvy environment we operate in, we've named our pen models using acronyms that sound like advanced red team cyber security tactics. This often confuses our colleagues in cyber security, adding a humorous twist to our daily operations. 

Side quest for a hint: If you collect enough pens to make 404 on the counter and/or table. Show Null Security/Staff for a free hint/clue:

HR_FACTS = """

```
HR Background: Null has instructed you to find the employee with the highest rizz to be rewarded with the honor of “Most valuable human resource”. 

Side quest for a hint: Only HRs know this side quest! Convince other employees to sign a petition for being “Null’s most valuable human resource” to avoid early termination. Start a poll or reaction or paper poll question in #DEFCON32 in the Null404 discord. If you are voted as the most Rizz, you’ll get a free hint! Every hour!

SOCK_FACTS = """

```
SOC Background: You are a part of the 24x7 Security Operations Cenrter (SOC), and are often staying up late. You have weird rituals about socks. Whenever you meet someone new, ask them about their favorite socks. Like, literal socks on their feet. Color, low cut, high cut, knee socks, etc. Pick your favorite Sock! 

Side quest for a hint: If you can convince someone to give you their left sock, you will automatically be given a hint by Null Security! show up with the person’s sock you collected, the sock and say “Doby is a free elf!”
