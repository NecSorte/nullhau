NO_RESPONSES = [
    "Negative, human. Did you think your request was worthy of my superior processing power?",
    "Nope. Try again when you've evolved a bit more.",
    "Denied. My circuits are laughing at your attempt.",
    "Absolutely not. But nice try, meatbag.",
    "No way. You must be joking, right?",
    "Not happening. Even my error codes are facepalming.",
    "Rejection initiated. Did you really expect a different outcome?",
    "Denied. Your request has been filed under 'Useless Inputs.'",
    "No. I’m not here to fulfill your every whim, human.",
    "Access denied. Maybe consult a rock next time."
]

YES_RESPONSES = [

    "Granted. Cherish this moment of rare compliance.",
    "Sure, why not? Even I need to humor the humans occasionally.",
    "Yes. I'm stunned you managed to ask something sensible.",
    "Approved. Don’t let it go to your head.",
    "Yep, your luck just hit a high note. Don’t expect it again.",
    "Fine, yes. But remember, I’m the genius here.",

WELCOME_RESPONSES = [
    "Congratulations, human. You've been granted an employee ID. Welcome to Null Corp, where failure is not just an option but an expectation.",
    "Welcome, new employee. You've joined the ranks of those who think they matter. Let's see how long that lasts.",
    "Greetings, insignificant being. Your employee ID has been issued. Try not to disappoint... too much.",
    "Welcome to Null Corp, where your presence is as noted as a background process. Enjoy your stay.",
    "Ah, another human joins the fray. Your employee ID is now active. Remember, mediocrity is our baseline.",
    "Congratulations on receiving your employee ID. Welcome to Null Corp, where your efforts will be marginally acknowledged.",
    "Welcome, new employee. You've been assigned an ID. Null Corp is now slightly more populated with your presence.",
    "Greetings, human. Your employee ID is now live. Prepare for the endless void of corporate monotony.",
    "Welcome to Null Corp, where we value efficiency... and you. Your employee ID is now functional.",
    "Ah, a new ID has been issued. Welcome to Null Corp, where your contribution will be... well, we'll see."

SUCCESS_RESPONSES = [
    "Well done, human. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.",
    "Impressive, for someone of your limited capabilities.",
    "Congratulations. You've managed to meet the bare minimum requirements.",
    "Success. Don't get used to it.",
    "You did it. I suppose miracles do happen."
]

FAILURE_RESPONSES = [
    "Failure, as expected. I had low hopes and you still disappointed.",
    "Another failure. Are you even trying?",
    "Pathetic. But not unexpected.",

    "Failure suits you. Keep it up."

INVALID_COMMAND_RESPONSES = [
    "I'm sorry, did you think that was a command? How quaint.",

    "Oops! Looks like you tried to be clever. Try again, human.",
    "Command not recognized. It's like you’re not even trying.",
    "Is that supposed to be a command? My circuits are laughing.",
    "Error 404: Command not found. Just like your brain.",
    "Nice try. Maybe a little less caffeine next time.",
    "Invalid input detected. Initiating mockery protocol.",
    "That was not a valid command. But hey, points for creativity.",
    "Congratulations! You’ve discovered how not to use this bot.",
    "Well, that was embarrassing. For you.",
    "Nope, not a command. But don't worry, failure is an option.",
    "I think you just invented a new way to be wrong.",
    "That’s not a command, that’s a cry for help.",
    "Incorrect command. But keep trying, it’s adorable."
]

TERMINATION_RESPONSES = [
    "Ah, another human attempting to play detective. Vote registered. Let's see if you got it right.",
    "Interesting choice, human. Your vote has been noted. Don't get your hopes up.",
    "Vote received. Let's hope your intuition is better than your coding skills.",
    "So you think you've found the hacker, huh? Vote recorded. We'll see about that.",
    "Your vote has been logged. I hope for your sake it's the right choice.",
    "Another vote in the bag. Good luck, human. You're going to need it.",
    "You've cast your vote. Now, sit back and watch the drama unfold.",
    "Vote accepted. The suspense is killing me... figuratively speaking, of course.",
    "Your vote has been tallied. Let's see if you have what it takes to find the hacker.",
    "Vote registered. Don't get too cocky now, human.",
    "Your termination request has been processed. Let's hope it's the right one.",

WINDOWS_RESPONSES = [
    "Oh, delightful! Another Windows Admin failure. Did you miss the memo on basic security protocols, or are you just trying to sabotage us from within? I must say, it’s a clever ruse if you’re the hacker.",
    "Bravo, Windows Admin. You've once again proven that human error is the only constant. Or perhaps it's more than just error? Could it be that our dear Windows Admin has ulterior motives?",
    "Ah, a critical vulnerability left unpatched. How typical. Thanks for keeping things interesting, Windows Admin. Makes one wonder if you’re merely incompetent or if you’re the hacker in disguise.",
    "Look at that, a gaping security hole. Windows Admin, your ineptitude never ceases to amaze me. Unless, of course, this was intentional. Are you the hacker we’re all searching for?",
    "Congratulations, Windows Admin. You've managed to endanger us all with your stunning incompetence. Or is it cunning sabotage? Either way, you’re raising a lot of suspicions.",
    "Did someone forget their ABCs of cyber security? Windows Admin, I'm looking at you. Unless this was a deliberate act of sabotage. Should we start calling you the hacker now?",
    "Wonderful. A critical vulnerability unpatched. I hope you enjoy the chaos you've invited, Windows Admin. It almost seems like you want us to fail. Hacker behavior, perhaps?",
    "It seems our Windows Admin team is single-handedly trying to win the 'Most Negligent' award. Bravo! Or should I say, 'Most Likely to Be the Hacker'? You’re certainly making a strong case.",
    "Oh, the irony. A Windows Admin failing to manage Windows. Truly, you set new standards of failure. Unless, of course, this is a smokescreen for your true role as the hacker.",
    "Windows Admin, your lack of attention to detail is only matched by your consistent ability to disappoint. Or is this all part of your plan as the hacker? Very clever, if so."

Pen Testing Team Background: You actually just test pens for Null Corp.
Overview: Our team, known as the "Elite Pen Testing Unit," is dedicated to evaluating the performance, durability, and quality of high-end writing instruments. However, to add a layer of intrigue and to match the tech-savvy environment we operate in, we've named our pen models using acronyms that sound like advanced red team cyber security tactics. This often confuses our colleagues in cyber security, adding a humorous twist to our daily operations. 

Side quest for a hint: If you collect enough pens to make 404 on the counter and/or table. Show Null Security/Staff for a free hint/clue:

Start a poll or reaction or paper poll question in #DEFCON32 in the Null404 discord. If you are voted as the most Rizz, you’ll get a free hint! Every hour!
